# Music-player-Project

## C# Music player Windows Standard Form

### Description:

This project was made a few months ago

I added this project because I learnt about .DLL files and you could use them on your application and they could give you features of anohter application.

I followed a tutorial and learnt a lot about C# and different types of projects.

### Things I learnt:

- Getting used to the toolbox
- Cleaner code
- Using the reference tool


### Constraints

None.

### Improvements:
- New improved interfaces
- Changing the design of the music player
- Fixing some bugs
