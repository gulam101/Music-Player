### Description:

The project allows the user to play their favourite song and keep on changing to different songs. If the user doesn't like the current song then they can skip it or they can find a new one and play it. They can use it to listen to music in the background.

### Insturctions:

User loads application and then click on the add button which would then ask them to point the song they want to play.

### Planned Features:
I would change the interface and then add a track list that allows the user to highlight songs and play them in the highlighted order. 

### Things I learnt:
- Using .DLL files
- Getting used to the toolbox
- Cleaner code
- Using the reference tool


### Constraints

None.

### Improvements:
- New improved interfaces
- Changing the design of the music player
- Fixing some bugs
