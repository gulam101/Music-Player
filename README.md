# Musicplayer-Project
This project was made a few months ago

I added this project because I learnt about .DLL files and you could use them on your application and they could give you features of anohter application.

I followed a tutorial and learnt a lot about C# and different types of projects.

Things I learnt:
Using .DLL files
Using some tools on the toolbox I never used before
Maintaing the code to some standard 
Using the refrence tool in Visual Studio

Things to add in the near future:
New improved interfaces
Correcting the code
Making the code simple
Adding comments
Changing the design of the music player
Fixing some bugs
